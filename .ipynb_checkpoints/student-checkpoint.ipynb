    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "_____\n",
    "Our bank has provided data on previous telemarketing campaigns and wishes to improve the number of subscriptions. Our goal is to utilize predictive analysis to develop a model which will optimize our 'target' selection when running telemarketing campaigns for term-deposits. We also aim to provide firm, data-driven recommendations to the business for potential future targeted telemarketing campaigns.\n",

    "## Methodology\n",

    "We will be utilizing the OSEMN Process for building our model. This is described by 5 steps:\n",

    "___\n",
    "A term deposit can be defined as a fixed-term investment that includes the deposit of money into an account at a financial institution. We want more customers to subscribe to our term deposit accounts because it give our business more certainty as to how much money is available for loans. Since term deposit accounts hold the money for a fixed amount of time at the cost of a higher interest rate, it prevents the contributor from withdrawing funds from the account for a fixed amount of time.

    "___\n",
    "Obtaining more subscribers to term-deposits means more revenue for our bank, and creating a sustainable pipeline for future campaigns will allow for increased revenue flow. We intend on utilizing predictive analysis to develop a model that can predict if a customer will invest in a term deposit with at least 80% accuracy."

    "This phase will take our data and create a more clear understanding of what it means. We will also begin to clean up missing values, placeholders, and begin to make our data more optimal for our Machine Learning algorithm. First, we will begin to ensure our data is formatted correctly and begin to collect basic metrics for the cleanliness of our data. Then we will move into the preprocessing phase by normalizing our quantitative data and using one-hot encoding to better classify our categorical data.\n",
